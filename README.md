# Unit 7 | Assignment - Distinguishing Sentiments

## Background

**Twitter** has become a wildly sprawling jungle of informationâ€”140 characters at a time. Somewhere between 350 million and 500 million tweets are estimated to be sent out _per day_. With such an explosion of data, on Twitter and elsewhere, it becomes more important than ever to tame it in some way, to concisely capture the essence of the data.

Choose **one** of the following two assignments, in which you will do just that. Good luck!

## News Mood

I create a Python script to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news outlets, and to present my findings visually.

It provides a visualized summary of the sentiments expressed in Tweets sent out by the following news organizations: **BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times**.

The first plot features the following:

* A scatter plot of sentiments of the last **100** tweets sent out by each news organization, ranging from -1.0 to 1.0, where a score of 0 expresses a neutral sentiment, -1 the most negative sentiment possible, and +1 the most positive sentiment possible.
* Each plot point reflects the _compound_ sentiment of a tweet.
* Each plot point are sorted by its relative timestamp.

The second plot is a bar plot visualizing the _overall_ sentiments of the last 100 tweets from each organization.

The tools of the trade I used include the following: tweepy, pandas, matplotlib, and VADER.
